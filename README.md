<h2>About the GPL-covered source code that I use in this repository‚öñÔ∏è</h2>

According to the DMCA, "a copyright holder must consider the existence of fair use before sending a takedown notification under ¬ß 512(c)." [1], and when using the source code of a GPL-covered program, the GPL grants you "fair use" rights [2] [3]. Therefore, regarding the GPL-covered source code that I'm using in this repository for research, educational, and non-commercial purposes, I concluded that since the GPL grants "fair use" rights [1], I'm lawfully and rightfully exercising my fair use rights as authorized by 17 U.S.C. ¬ß 107 and the GPL. At the same time, I uphold and cherish the copyright holders' rights. 

Additionally, "If a copyright holder ignores or neglects our unequivocal holding that it must consider fair use before sending a takedown notification, it is liable for damages under ¬ß 512(f)." [3] Submitting false, fraudulent, and/or bad faith information could result in civil liability ‚Äî that is, you could get sued and you could be fined or imprisoned for not more than five years, or both.
